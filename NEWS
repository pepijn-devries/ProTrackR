ProTrackR v0.1.3 (Release date: 2015-09-25)
=============

 * Some more minor fixes to pass CRAN checks.


ProTrackR v0.1.2 (Release date: 2015-09-25)
=============

 * Minor fixes to pass CRAN checks.

 * In the 'playSample' method, the 'finetune' argument is now
   correctly passed to the 'noteToSampleRate' function.
   Before, it was only possible to play at the finetune
   specified for a sample.

 * Correction in the validity check for objects of S4 class
   'PTSample': wlooplen is allowed to have a value of zero
   when the sample is empty.

 * The prototype of the S4 class 'PTSample' is changed to
   set the wlooplen value to zero.

 * The slot descriptions for wloopstart and wlooplen in the
   'PTSample' documentation contained errors that were
   corrected.

 * The 'loopLength<-', the 'PTSample-method' and 'read.sample'
   methods were modified to handle the adjustments to the
   'PTSample' class.

 * Removed superfluous argument 'value' from the
   'patternLength' method

ProTrackR v0.1.1 (Release date: 2015-09-25)
=============

First release:

 * Provided the basis for importing, exporting and manipulating
   ProTracker modules.

   only (not the module itself).
