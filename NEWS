ProTrackR v0.3.4 (Release date: 2016-11-25)
=============

 * added a "fix.PTModule" method that attempts to
   fix a module object when it is not conform
   ProTracker specs...

 * period limits for the porta effects have been fixed

 * inverted the logical interpretation of the
   'verbose' argument, as it was incorrect in
   earlier versions.

 * added and modified several of the 'modArchive'-
   functions, for better support from www.modarchive.org

 * modified S4-object validation functions such that
   they run faster.

 * modified 'write.module'-method such that it will
   write modules much faster

 * fixed bug in 'read.module'-method and modified it
   such that it will read modules much faster.

 * fixed bug in 'loopStart<-'-method

 * fixed bug in 'loopLength<-'-method

 * fixed bug in 'patternOrder<-'-method

 * fixed bug in 'appendPattern'-method

 * fixed bug in 'volume<-'-method

 * fixed bug in 'waveform<-'- and 'waveform'-method

ProTrackR v0.3.3 (Release date: 2016-03-26)
=============

 * Minor correction in manual.

ProTrackR v0.3.2 (Release date: 2016-03-25)
=============

 * Minor corrections in manual.

ProTrackR v0.3.1 (Release date: 2016-03-25)
=============

 * Modified the playing routine such that the porta
   effects can't slide period values below that of note
   B-3 or above 856. Period values are cut-off at these
   values after processing the other effects as well.
   Thanks must go to Olav SÃ¸rensen (who created a
   Protracker v2.3D clone for modern machines,
   http://16-bits.org/pt.php) for confirming these
   software and hardware limits.

 * Resampling routine in the modToWave-method is rewritten.
   It should be faster now.

 * The 9xy command is now implemented such that it
   emulates the ProTracker 'offset bug'. Therewith,
   the player routine now passes 'ptoffset.mod' test.

 * Bug in resampling of samples in 'modToWave'-
   routine is fixed.

 * 'modArchive' functions are added to the package.

 * Effect commands 'E4x' and 'E7x' are now implemented
   in the player routine.

 * Implementation of effect command '5xy' is fixed.

 * In the previous release, some generated wave data ended
   up out of range in the mixing procedure. This is now fixed.

 * The 'playWave'-method is modified such that it
   returns an 'audioInstance'-object (audio package)
   allowing control over the playback.

 * Minor corrections/improvements to the manual

 * Mixing when some tracks are turned off is fixed

ProTrackR v0.2.3 (Release date: 2015-11-07)
=============

 * Minor corrections in manual to pass
   CRAN checks.

ProTrackR v0.2.2 (Release date: 2015-11-07)
=============

 * Minor corrections in manual to pass
   CRAN checks.

ProTrackR v0.2.1 (Release date: 2015-11-07)
=============

 * 'clearSamples'-method was added to the package.

 * 'clearSong'-method was added to the package.

 * 'modToWave'-method was added to the package

 * 'playingtable'-method was added to the package

 * 'playMod'-method was added to the package

 * 'playWave'-method was added to the package

 * 'resample'-function added to the package
   to avoid 'seewave' dependency (which is
   not available for all platforms).

 * 'waveform'-method now includes additional
   arguments: 'start.pos', 'stop.pos' and 'loop'

 * removed 'utils' import...

 * 'name' method, for PTSample objects, incorrectly
   returned raw representation of the sample name
   instead of a character representation. This is
   now fixed.

 * 'playSample' was printing the names of additional
   (...) arguments in previous release. This was meant
   as a test and this behaviour was not intended for
   the release. It has been removed.

 * A section on ProTracker effect commands is
   added to the manual

 * Some minor corrections were made in the manual

ProTrackR v0.1.3 (Release date: 2015-09-25)
=============

 * Some more minor fixes to pass CRAN checks.


ProTrackR v0.1.2 (Release date: 2015-09-25)
=============

 * Minor fixes to pass CRAN checks.

 * In the 'playSample' method, the 'finetune' argument is
   now correctly passed to the 'noteToSampleRate' function.
   Before, it was only possible to play at the finetune
   specified for a sample.

 * Correction in the validity check for objects of S4 class
   'PTSample': wlooplen is allowed to have a value of zero
   when the sample is empty.

 * The prototype of the S4 class 'PTSample' is changed to
   set the wlooplen value to zero.

 * The slot descriptions for wloopstart and wlooplen in the
   'PTSample' documentation contained errors that were
   corrected.

 * The 'loopLength<-', the 'PTSample-method' and 'read.sample'
   methods were modified to handle the adjustments to the
   'PTSample' class.

 * Removed superfluous argument 'value' from the
   'patternLength' method

ProTrackR v0.1.1 (Release date: 2015-09-25)
=============

First release:

 * Provided the basis for importing, exporting and manipulating
   ProTracker modules.

 * Basic playing routine, playing the samples in the module
   only (not the module itself).
