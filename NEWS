ProTrackR v0.2.3 (Release date: 2015-11-07)
=============

 * Minor corrections in manual to pass
   CRAN checks.

ProTrackR v0.2.2 (Release date: 2015-11-07)
=============

 * Minor corrections in manual to pass
   CRAN checks.

ProTrackR v0.2.1 (Release date: 2015-11-07)
=============

 * 'clearSamples'-method was added to the package.

 * 'clearSong'-method was added to the package.

 * 'modToWave'-method was added to the package

 * 'playingtable'-method was added to the package

 * 'playMod'-method was added to the package

 * 'playWave'-method was added to the package

 * 'resample'-function added to the package
   to avoid 'seewave' dependency (which is
   not available for all platforms).

 * 'waveform'-method now includes additional
   arguments: 'start.pos', 'stop.pos' and 'loop'

 * removed 'utils' import...

 * 'name' method, for PTSample objects, incorrectly
   returned raw representation of the sample name
   instead of a character representation. This is
   now fixed.

 * 'playSample' was printing the names of additional
   (...) arguments in previous release. This was meant
   as a test and this behaviour was not intended for
   the release. It has been removed.

 * A section on ProTracker effect commands is
   added to the manual

 * Some minor corrections were made in the manual

ProTrackR v0.1.3 (Release date: 2015-09-25)
=============

 * Some more minor fixes to pass CRAN checks.


ProTrackR v0.1.2 (Release date: 2015-09-25)
=============

 * Minor fixes to pass CRAN checks.

 * In the 'playSample' method, the 'finetune' argument is
   now correctly passed to the 'noteToSampleRate' function.
   Before, it was only possible to play at the finetune
   specified for a sample.

 * Correction in the validity check for objects of S4 class
   'PTSample': wlooplen is allowed to have a value of zero
   when the sample is empty.

 * The prototype of the S4 class 'PTSample' is changed to
   set the wlooplen value to zero.

 * The slot descriptions for wloopstart and wlooplen in the
   'PTSample' documentation contained errors that were
   corrected.

 * The 'loopLength<-', the 'PTSample-method' and 'read.sample'
   methods were modified to handle the adjustments to the
   'PTSample' class.

 * Removed superfluous argument 'value' from the
   'patternLength' method

ProTrackR v0.1.1 (Release date: 2015-09-25)
=============

First release:

 * Provided the basis for importing, exporting and manipulating
   ProTracker modules.

 * Basic playing routine, playing the samples in the module
   only (not the module itself).
