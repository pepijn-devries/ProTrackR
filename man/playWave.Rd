\title{Play Wave objects}
\usage{
\S4method{playWave}{Wave}(wave, wait = T)

\S4method{playWave}{WaveMC}(wave, wait = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{An object of class \code{\link[tuneR]{Wave}} or
\code{\link[tuneR]{WaveMC}}. Note that the playing routine implemented
here can only play stereo waves. Multi-channel waves are therefore
converted to stereo before playing.}

\item{wait}{A \code{logical} value. When set to \code{TRUE} the playing
routine will wait with executing any code until the playing is
finished. When set to \code{FALSE}, subsequent R code will be
executed while playing.}
}
\value{
Returns an \code{\link[audio]{$.audioInstance}}.
}
\description{
Use the command line \code{\link[audio]{play}} function from the
\code{audio} package to play \code{\link[tuneR]{Wave}} objects.
}
\details{
As the \code{\link{tuneR}} package play-function relies on external
players, this method is provided as a convenient approach to play
samples in the R console, using the \code{audio} package. Wave
objects are played at the rate as specified in the object. Of course
you can also play the \code{Wave} objects with the \code{tuneR} implementation
of \code{\link{tuneR}{play}}, by calling \code{tuneR::play(wave)}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data(mod.intro)

## PTSample objects can also be
## played with this function as they
## are a child of the Wave object:
playWave(PTSample(mod.intro, 2))
}
